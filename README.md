# search-string
In this assignment you will write a program that will accept a string and a search term from the user. Your program will then ask the user if they want to consider spaces and if upper and lower case should be considered as different. All of these will be accepted as strings and int values will be parsed as needed. It then tells the user if the search term is in the string or not, ignoring spaces and case as asked, and where the term was in the string.
